# Weather Bot

A simple Node.js bot that uses the BBC Weather API to check the weather at my office's location. Then, it sends the details nicely formatted to Slack and it includes an alert for ice if it's too cold and a dress-down alert for when it's too hot.

## The Stack
* Node.js
* Windows Scheduler to run it on... a schedule :)
